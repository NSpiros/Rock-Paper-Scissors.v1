# Rock-Paper-Scissors.v1

A game of Rock-Paper-Scissors no ui ,plain js.

Created for function learning and loops.

<!-- UPDATE -->

Added UI elements along with some interactions and responsive
while working with JS Event Listeners

<!-------------FINAL UPDATE------------>

A project made for The Odin Project.
Lasted a few days to develop and i hope u enjoy it..I did..!!

Aimed for a retro-arcade style for the ui.

Some of the things i had to work with were :
Functions
Methods
EventListeners
Animation
Transition
DOM Manipulation
Work around with more flex capabilities
and of course work with GITHUB branches!

To wrap it up i think it was a step forward to what i learned so far in this project!

<!-- THANK YOU FOR PLAYING -->
